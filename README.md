# Frontend Take Home Project


#### The purpose of this project is to gauge your technical skills and ability to design and implement a well-functioning, performant, and maintainable frontend application. The goal is not to waste your time or have you do work for us for free -- your take home project does not have any practical use for our products. 

## Brief
Please create a column-based To Do application, similar to a JIRA Kanban or Trello board, to be viewed and interacted with in a web browser. Once the project is complete, please open a PR against this repo for us to review. 

### Please do not spend too many hours working on this project -- we're more interested in how you work and solve problems than we are perfection

### Feature Requirements
* Every To Do should default to 3 columns: To Do, Doing, and Done.
* Each todo should exist on a "card" and cards should be able to be dragged and dropped between columns.
* Each card should have a Title and Description
* Users should be able to create and delete cards as necessary
* Uses should be able to create and delete columns as necessary
* Each card should have a direct link to it, so that going to "myapp.com/todo/<cardID>" displays the card title and description

### Design Considerations
* Because there's no backend, feel free to use whatever storage you think is best (browser state, etc.)
* You have full design and UI creativity -- we want to see your creativity alongside your technical ability!

### Technical
* Please do not use any AI code tools like Copilot, ChatGPT, Cursor, Claude, or other LLMs. We want to see how YOU write code, not how an LLM writes code.
* Use whatever framework you think is best for the application -- or no framework at all.
* No need for 100% test coverage, but please at least include a few tests for us to review.
* We should be able to get your application up and running without a lot of work, so please include any scripts, dependency lists, etc. that are necessary to build and/or run the app. Makefiles, Dockerfiles, etc. are encouraged.


### Process
Once complete, create a Pull Request (PR) against this repository so we can review your submission. After review, if we decide to move forward with your interview process, we will sit down and review your code, so please be prepared to talk about design decisions, trade-offs, future improvements, etc.


If you have any questions or need clarification please send your recruiter a message.

Thanks, and happy coding!
